# 90-Day ML Architect Journey

Welcome! This is my public learning journal as I work toward becoming a Machine Learning Architect in 90 days. I'm documenting everything I learn—concepts, tools, projects, and challenges—week by week.

## Structure

- **/posts** — Weekly learning notes and topics (math, models, MLOps)
- **/projects** — End-to-end ML project writeups with code + results
- **/resources** — Useful links and references
- **/about** — My background and journey motivation
